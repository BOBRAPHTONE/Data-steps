# Data-steps
A simple Data science project that seeks to orient Artificial Intelligence problem solving. 

This is the code for  gender classification.It uses the scikit-learn machine learning library to train a decision tree on a small dataset of body metrics (height, width, and shoe size) labeled male or female. Then we can predict the gender of someone given a novel set of body metrics.

##Dependencies

Scikit-learn (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)

numpy (pip install numpy)

scipy (pip install scipy)

Install missing dependencies using pip

##Usage

Once you have your dependencies installed via pip, run the script in terminal via
 
``` python gender.py ```


#Challenge 
Find 3 more classifiers from the sci-kit learn documentation and add them to the gender.py code. Train them on the same dataset and compare their results. You can determine accuracy by trying to predict testing you trained classifier on samples from the training data and see if it correctly classifies it.

push to git as a branch of this repo.


Happy coding!
